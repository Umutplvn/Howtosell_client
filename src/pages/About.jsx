                My journey in sales started unknowingly at an early age. I grew
                up in Ireland, and as a kid, I’d go door-to-door. I had little
                hustles throughout all my early years — I just wanted money for
                extra things my parents didn’t want to buy me. Naturally, I’m
                actually quite introverted, but those early experiences taught
                me that if you want to make money, it pays to shake hands &
                knock on doors.

              one-way flight to Dubai. This was where I truly paid my dues in
              sales.

              In Dubai's real estate market, competition was intense—there were
              a million agents and no base salary, only commission. I arrived
              with enough savings for just two or three months. It was sink or
              swim. <br /> <br />I chose to swim. <br /> <br />
              Every day, I'd arrive at the office at 8 AM and start cold calling
              until 8 PM. The only reason I'd stop was because calling people
              after 9 PM tended to get on their nerves a bit more than usual.
              This relentless routine taught me resilience and the art of
              perseverance!

              After some time, I moved back to Ireland because I didn't like
              seeing my family only once or twice a year. Money comes and goes,
              and now, with the internet, we can get it independent of location.
              But time with our loved ones is limited.

              <br /> Back in Ireland, I began selling fitness memberships and
              quickly became the top seller at a high-end fitness club. Coming
              from the shark tank of Dubai, it felt like jumping into the kiddie
              pool. <br /> <br />I ran laps around the other sellers by building

              One of the gym members caught my attention. He was my age, drove a
              Porsche, and was very particular about his workouts. I noticed
              that the way people work out often reflects how they approach
              other aspects of their lives. He'd come in quickly, get the work
              done efficiently, and leave.
              <br />
              <br />
              Curiosity piqued, I struck up a conversation with him. Over a

              The rest is history. I started working with him—Twana—as hire
              number three in his software company. Initially, it was just me,
              him, and Marco in a modest office. Together, we scaled the company
              from a single client to over 20 enterprise clients and grew the

              After serving as Head of Sales for a few years, I felt the urge to
              pursue my own path. I ventured into weight loss coaching and began
              creating content on TikTok. My content resonated with many, and I
              garnered over 350,000 followers, helping numerous clients achieve
              their fitness goals and I enjoyed the sales and marketing side of
              it, but coaching weight loss had lost its appeal to me.

              Despite the success, I realized I wasn't following my true passion
              and dream <strong>to help people win in sales!</strong>
              The same gift that helped me become a top seller in real estate
              and fitness sales and help scale a software company from scratch
              was what I truly wanted to share with others.
