                My journey in sales started unknowingly at an early age. As a
                kid, Iâ€™d go door-to-door and I had little hustles throughout my
                early yearsâ€“ I just wanted money for video games. Naturally, Iâ€™m
                quite introverted but those early experiences taught me, if you
                want to make money, it pays to shake hands & knock on doors.

              strength and fitness society. I organized fitness classes and

              sales job in real estate. Feeling great in my new suit, I packed a
              suitcase, kissed my mum goodbye, and took a one-way flight to
              Dubai. This was where I truly paid my dues in sales.

              In Dubai's real estate market, competition was fierceâ€”there were a
              million agents and no base salary, only commission. I arrived with
              enough savings for just two or three months. It was sink or swim.{" "}
              <br /> <br />I chose to swim. <br /> <br />
              Every day, I'd arrive at the office at 8 AM and start cold calling
              until 8 PM. The only reason I'd stop was because calling people
              after 9 PM tended to get on their nerves a bit more than usual.
              This relentless routine taught me resilience and the art of
              perseverance.

              After some time, I moved back to Ireland because I didn't like
              seeing my family only once or twice a year. I also saw many people
              in their 40s and 50s still stuck on the same hamster wheel they
              started on at 20 years old when they first came to Dubai â€“ I
              didnâ€™t want that.
              <br />
              <br /> Back in Ireland, I began selling fitness memberships and
              quickly became the top seller. Coming from the shark tank of
              Dubai, it felt like jumping into the kiddie pool. I ran laps
              around the other sellers by building genuine relationships with
              all my customers.

              The rest is history. I started working with himâ€”Twanaâ€”as hire
              number three in his software company. Initially, it was just me,
              him, and Marco in a modest office. Together, we scaled the company
              from a single client to over 20 enterprise clients and grew the
              team to over 100 employees.

              After serving as Head of Sales for a few years, I felt the urge to
              pursue my own path. I ventured into weight loss coaching and began
              creating content on TikTok. My content resonated with many, and I
              garnered over 350,000 followers, helping numerous clients achieve
              their fitness goals and I enjoyed the sales and marketing side of
              it, but coaching weight loss had lost its appeal to me.

and help scale a software company from scratch, was what I truly wanted to share with others.
